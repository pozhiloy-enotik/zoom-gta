## And now the most interesting))
### How does the program work?
Since you can‚Äôt just put an animated gif on your profile picture in Zoom, this program breaks it into frames and puts them in turn on your profile picture

### Limitations:
#### Works best with square gifs. You can crop here https://ezgif.com/crop
#### In the same place, you can delete unnecessary frames, I advise you to do this

#### The avatar update interval in the zoom client is about 1 second, which means that if the number of frames in your gif is 50, it will take about a minute to fully play it. Gif templates are in the examples/ folder
#### It is necessary to select a delay somewhere from 0.5 to 1 second.
##### Delay collection algorithm:
##### If there is frame drop, increase
##### If you need faster - reduce
To change the delay while the program is running:
- press Ctrl+C
- enter 4
